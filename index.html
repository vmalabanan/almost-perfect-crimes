      <h2>Almost Perfect Crimes: A Lesson from <em>Death in Paradise</em></h2>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Great mystery stories typically involve compelling characters, a
        seemingly impossible crime, twisty trails of clues and red herrings, and
        a solution that feels surprising, inevitable, and most of all,
        satisfying. In this post we’ll explore the almost perfect crime through
        the lens of the most popular programs on British television.

      <p class="blog-text">
        The blueprint for most mysteries—and for every Death in Paradise
        episode—is this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A short introduction to the protagonist/cast of characters going about
          their lives in the time before the mystery is revealed.
        </li>
        <li>
          A mystery is presented—often murder and/or a seemingly impossible
          crime.
        </li>
        <li>
          The protagonist gradually unravels the who, what, when, where, and why
          of the crime, obtaining information that sheds new light on the crime,
          victim, and suspects. The protagonist typically chases some false
          leads and red herrings.
        </li>
        <li>The protagonist solves the crime.</li>
        <li>Story-world matters not related to the crime are wrapped up.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Traditionally, the protagonist solves the crime. For this to happen, the
        crime must be almost perfect—that's because a perfect crime would be, by
        definition, unsolvable. To put it another way: imperfections in the way
        the crime was carried out generate the clues the protagonist needs to
        solve the crime.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text">
        In Death in Paradise, the murderers always make a mistake, usually
        following into the following categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Poor planning—or, more often: naiveite. The perpetrator tends to
          believe that no one else will notice tiny clues left at the crime
          scene (these are often discrepancies: things that should be there but
          aren't, or things that shouldn't be there but are). However, the
          protagonist almost always notices these hard-to-spot details
          (eventually).
        </li>
        <li>
          For spur-of-the-moment crimes: lack of time or options means the
          perpetrator has less optimal options for weapon disposal, etc. Things
          get messy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Things not going according to plan—for example, unaccounted for
          witnesses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Scene</h3>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman is having dinner at a hotel and
        notices one of the guests drunkenly stumble back to his room. The hotel
        is a family affair, run by the man's brother and sister-in-law, and was
        the brothers' childhood home. The man hasn't set foot in the house in 20
        years and has just come from the kitchen and is carrying a plate with a
        sandwich on it.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Ten minutes later, the housekeeper finds the man stabbed to death in his
        room. No one else is around. His watch and wallet are missing, the
        murder weapon is nowhere to be found, and his balcony doors are flung
        open.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text">
        DI Goodman had a clear view of the one staircase leading to the man's
        room, and besides the housekeeper, no one went up or down the stairs
        after the man went up. His room is the only one at the top of the
        stairs.
      </p>

      <h3>The Clues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The ground beneath the man's balcony is undisturbed (no footprints).
        </li>
        <li>
          A decades-old pack of cigarettes is sitting on the victim's bedside
          table. The cigarettes are too old to smoke, no one recognizes the
          pack, and those close to the victim say he hasn't smoked since he was
          a teenager. His mother had disapproved of the habit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Things not going according to plan—for example, unaccounted for
          witnesses.
        </li>
      </ul>

        the victim’s room is a clue that helps unravel the mystery of who killed
        him and why. (image: eBay)
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p class="blog-text">
        The man had been stabbed by his sister-in-law in the kitchen. They were
        secret lovers, and there were extenuating circumstances to the stabbing.
        In his dying moments, the man tried to divert attention away from her:
        he thew the knife in the dishwasher, used her scarf to control the
        bleeding, and walked back with the plated sandwich to make it seem to
        anyone watching that he was okay (and only drunk, not stabbed). Once
        upstairs, he set the stage for a robbery gone wrong: he flung open the
        balcony doors, then hid his watch, wallet, and the scarf in a secret
        hiding place in the baseboards—which he’d used as a teenager to hide
        packs of cigarettes.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text">
        Here's where the <em>almost</em> perfect part comes in: there was still
        an old pack of cigarettes in the hiding space, which he needed to take
        out to make everything else fit. This clue helps DI Goodman realize the
        crime could've only been committed one way. Without it, we'd still have
        the undisturbed ground below the balcony pointing to the crime being
        committed by someone still in the hotel, but that wouldn't be enough to
        narrow things down. We'd need other clues.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-text final-paragraph">
        Of course, the story could have been done countless ways with other sets
        of clues, but the lesson here is this: the protagonist needs clues to
        solve the crime. They need an <em>almost</em> perfect murder.
